\arguments{
\item{isim}{An integer value. A value of \code{runIDs_todo} as subset of
\code{runIDs_total}, i.e., a consecutive index across loops 1+2b}

\item{runN}{An integer value. The number of runs/sites set up in the master input file,
i.e., \eqn{runN == runsN_master}.}

\item{scN}{An integer value. The number of (climate) scenarios used in the project,
i.e., \eqn{scN == sim_scens[["N"]]}.}

\item{sc}{An integer value. The index along \code{scN}.}
}
\value{
An integer value of the index in loop 1 based on the position
 across loops 1+2b; invariant to \code{include_YN}.

An integer value out of 'runIDs_sites', i.e., the position in loop 2b based on
 position across loops 1+2b; invariant to \code{include_YN}.

An integer value of the index across all loops 1+2a+3, invariant
 to \code{include_YN}. A consecutive identification number for each possible SOILWAT2
 simulation--used as the ID for the output database.

\section{Simulation runs}{

 * Simulations are run over three nested loops
   - loop1 (1...expN) nested in loop2b (1...runsN_sites) nested in loop3 (1...scN)
       - Note: loop3 (along scenarios) occurs within the function 'do_OneSite'
       - Note: loop2b is a subset of loop2a (1...runsN_master)
   - column 'include_YN' reduces 'site_id' to 'runIDs_sites'
   - 'site_id' and 'P_id' are invariant to 'include_YN'

 * Master input file: column 'include_YN' selects rows which are included in the
   simulation
   - Note: rows of the master input file correspond to rows of the treatment input file
   - column 'site_id' == consecutive identification numbers of all rows in the master
     file; this is treated as a unique (and stable) identifier of a site
   - runsN_master == number of rows in the master file
   - runIDs_master == consecutive identification numbers along runsN_master
   - runsN_sites == number of rows in the master file that are included;
     runsN_sites <= max(site_id) and runsN_sites == length(runIDs_sites)
   - runIDs_sites == values of runIDs_master which are included

 * Experimental input file: each row defines a condition which is applied to every
   runIDs_sites
   - expN == number of experimental treatments

 * The function 'do_OneSite' will be called n-times with n = runsN_call
   - runsN_job == (number of included sites) x (number of experimental treatments)
     == runsN_sites x expN
   - runIDs_job == consecutive identification numbers along runsN_job
   - runsN_total == (number of sites) x (number of experimental treatments)
     == runsN_master x expN
   - runIDs_total == consecutive identification numbers along runsN_total
   - runIDs_done == values of runIDs_total that have already been processed by
     'do_OneSite'
   - runIDs_todo == values of runIDs_total that await simulation by 'do_OneSite'
   - runsN_todo == number of runIDs_total that await simulation by 'do_OneSite'

 * The function 'do_OneSite' could be called n-times with n = runsN_incl if all
   'include_YN' were on
   - runsN_incl == runsN_total

 * The variable 'climate.conditions' defines climate conditions that are applied to
   each 'runIDs_total'
   - scN == number of climate conditions

 * A grand total of n = runsN_Pid SOILWAT2 runs could be carried out (n == number of
   rows in the output database)
   - runsN_Pid == max(P_id) == runsN_total x scN == runsN_master x expN x scN
   - P_id == a unique consecutive identification number for each possible SOILWAT2
     simulation; used as the ID for the output database
