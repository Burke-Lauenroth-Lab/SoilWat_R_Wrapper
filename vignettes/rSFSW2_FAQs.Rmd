# Frequently asked questions and answers


<a name="SetupProject"/></a>

## How do I set up a new simulation project?

1) Install and attach [rSFSW2][rSFSW2] if not already done so (Note: required
  version of [rSOILWAT2][rSOILWAT2] must already be installed on your computer).
2) Create a skeleton project by calling the function
  `setup_rSFSW2_project_infrastructure(dir_prj = "path/to/project_folder")`. This
  function will copy a default version of input data to '1_Data_SWInput' and three
  demo R files to your directory.
3) Work your way through the file 'SFSW2_project_code.R', i.e., define paths and actions,
  and provide simulation project description in 'SFSW2_project_descriptions.R' and run
  settings in 'SFSW2_project_settings.R'


<a name="MissingSoils"/></a>

## How does rSFSW2/SOILWAT2 handle missing soil data?
[rSOILWAT2][rSOILWAT2] will fail if soil data are missing.
[rSFSW2][rSFSW2] distinguishes three cases:

1) The topmost/first soil layer has missing data: [rSFSW2][rSFSW2] marks the 'create'
  section of this run as failed.
2) A continuous number of bottommost/deepest soil layer(s) have missing data: If
  opt_sim[["fix_depth_to_layers"]] is TRUE, then the simulated soil depth is reduced to
  the maximal depth for which soil data are available; if opt_sim[["fix_depth_to_layers"]]
  is FALSE (default), then simulated soil depth is the maximal value of 'depth_LX'
  which is <= 'SoilDepth_cm' and missing soil data are imputed with the LOCF method
  'last-observation-carried-forward' (from shallow to deep layers).
3) Soil layer(s) within the soil profile have missing data: [rSFSW2][rSFSW2] imputes
  soil data with the LOCF method.


<a name="SimulatedSoilDepth"/></a>

## Is the simulated soil depth the value entered in file 'SWRuns_InputData_SoilLayers_v9.csv'?
The columns 'SoilDepth_cm' and 'depth_LX', with X = 1, 2, 3, ... the soil layer
numbers, in the file 'SWRuns_InputData_SoilLayers_v9.csv', whether or not the
corresponding columns (density, sand, clay, etc.) in the file
'SWRuns_InputData_soils_v12.csv' have appropriate values (e.g., not NA), and the
value of the flag opt_sim[["fix_depth_to_layers"]] as read in from the file
'SFSW2_project_descriptions.R' determine together the simulated soil depth at a
site. If every 'depth_LX' <= 'SoilDepth_cm' is not NA and every corresponding
soil data column from 'SWRuns_InputData_soils_v12' is not NA, then simulated
soil depth is the maximal value of 'depth_LX' which is <= 'SoilDepth_cm'. See also
[point 2 in the missing soil FAQ](#MissingSoils) in case of missing data.


<a name="PercolationAtSoilDepth"/></a>

## Does percolation stop or become impeded at the simulated soil depth?
SOILWAT2 percolates soil moisture to the bottom of the deepest soil layer from
where further percolation is considered 'deep drainage', i.e., water leaves the
simulated system and is no longer potentially accessible by plant roots. If you
set impermeability of the deepest soil layer to a value > 0, then you could
simulate impeded percolation. However, impermeability is set by default to 0.


<a name="SoilDepthEffects"/></a>

## How does soil depth affect soil water?
Soil depth determines total available soil moisture. For example, let's say
we have two identical soils where volumetric water content at field capacity is
0.3 and VWC at the limit of moisture extraction for a vegetation is 0.15, but
one soil profile is 1 m deep and the other is 2 m deep. Soil depth causes the
first soil to have a total of 15 cm of available water whereas the second,
deeper soil has 30 cm of available water. That is an important difference for
vegetation. Please, consider that soil layers will not affect the simulation outcome
(besides for deep drainage rates) unless you include plant roots in those layers in
the simulation.


<a name="Labels_vs_SiteID"/></a>

## What is the difference between 'Label' and 'site_id' in the file 'SWRuns_InputMaster_YOURPROJECT_v11.csv'?
The field 'site_id' is a consecutive running integer serving as index for all the rows
in the master input file. The field 'Label' takes character values and can be used to
provide human readable site names.
