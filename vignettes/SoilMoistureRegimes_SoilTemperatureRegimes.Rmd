This vignette explains how rSFSW2 has implemented the calculations of soil moisture regime (SMR) and soil temperature regime (STR) and compares the logic with the Java Newhall Simulation Model and with the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.

## Notes
* Quoted text is directly from [SSS 2014](#SSS2014).  So direction of a logic may be opposite of a condition, which will be indicated by \! before the condition.
* jNSM calculations can be found at end of this document. Line numbers refer to file 'BASICSimulationModel.java'

## Soil Moisture Regimes

### Undefined
* rSFSW2
    * not one of {[perudic](#perudic), [aridic](#aridic), [xeric](#xeric), [ustic](#ustic), [udic](#udic), [anhydrous](#anhydrous)}
* [jNSM 2016](#jNSM2016) (line 3060)
    * not one of {[perudic](#perudic), [aridic](#aridic), [xeric](#xeric), [ustic](#ustic), [udic](#udic)}


### Perudic
* Regime characteristic of areas where precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration every month
* rSFSW2
    * [COND0](#COND0)
* [jNSM 2016](#jNSM2016) (lines 2977ff)
    * perudic: [[COND0](#COND0)] swt != 0
* Characteristics ([SSS 2014](#SSS2014))
    * [[COND0](#COND0)] precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration in all months of normal years
    * the moisture tension rarely reaches 100 kPa in the soil moisture control section
* Generalized Characteristics ([SSS 2015](#SSS2015))
    * The soil is almost always moist; soil tension is rarely > 100 kPa (about >1 bar)
    * Precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration by plants in every month.
* Remarks
    * Somewhat unclear if PET or AET should be compared with PPT. "evapotranspiration by plants" sounds like AET, but jNSM uses PET. rSFSW2 follows jNSM and uses PET.


### Udic
* Regime characteristic of humid regions with seasonally well distributed precipitation
* rSFSW2

    + __AND__
    + "except for short periods, a three- phase system, solid-liquid-gas, in part or all of the soil moisture control section when the soil temperature is above 5 C"
* Generalized Characteristics ([SSS 2015](#SSS2015))
    * Soil is dry < 90 cumulative days in most years
    * Soil is dry < 45 consecutive days in summer and early fall (except in very warm areas and locations where there is little difference between summer and winter soil temperatures).
* Remarks
    * jNSM ignores [COND4](#COND4), [COND5](#COND5), and [COND6](#COND6)
    * rSFSW2 and jNSM ignore "except for short periods, a three- phase system, solid-liquid-gas, in part or all of the soil moisture control section when the soil temperature is above 5 C"

    * During the growing season:

## Soil Temperature Regimes
We currently ignore the 'iso-' prefix, i.e., "the mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures differ by less than 6 oC at a depth of 50 cm or at a densic, lithic, or paralithic contact, whichever is shallower", which is applicable to [frigid](#Frigid), [mesic](#Mesic), [thermic](#Thermic), and [hyperthermic](#Hyperthermic) regimes ([SSS 2014](#SSS2014))

### Permafrost
* Permanently frozen layers
* "Permafrost may be impregnated by ice or, in the case of insufficient interstitial water, may be dry." ([SSS 2014](#SSS2014))
* rSFSW2
    * [stCOND0](#stCOND0)
* [jNSM 2016](#jNSM2016): not considered
* Characteristics ([p. 28 in SSS 2014](#SSS2014))
    + [[stCOND0](#stCOND0)] "a thermal condition in which a material (including soil material) remains below 0 C for 2 or more years in succession"
* Generalized Characteristics ([SSS 2015](#SSS2015))
    * p. 3-101: "Layer has temperature of < 0 C for 2 or more consecutive years."


### Gelic
* "Gelic materials are [mineral](#MSM) or [organic soil materials](#OSM) that show evidence of cryoturbation (frost churning) and/or ice segregation in the active layer (seasonal thaw layer) and/or the upper part of the permafrost" ([SSS 2014](#SSS2014))
* "The gelic soil temperature regime has not been documented in soils of the continental U.S. but occurs in the soils of Alaska." ([SSS 2015](#SSS2015))
* rSFSW2
    * [stCOND1](#stCOND1) | [stCOND0](#stCOND0)

    + [[stCOND1](#stCOND1)] "mean annual soil temperature at or below 0 C (in Gelic suborders and Gelic great groups) or 1 C or lower (in Gelisols)"
* Generalized Characteristics ([SSS 2015](#SSS2015))
    * "Soil is <= 0 C"


### Cryic
* Cryic soils are cold but have no permafrost and they are cold also during summer.
* "Too cold for virtually all crops" ([SSS 2015](#SSS2015))

* Generalized Characteristics ([SSS 2015](#SSS2015))
    * "Soil is > 0 to < 8 C but has no permafrost and summer temperatures are also cold"
* Remarks
    * [jNSM 2016](#jNSM2016) does not distinguish between [mineral](#MSM) and [organic material](#OSM). Thus, it ignores conditions [stCOND5](#stCOND5), [stCOND6](#stCOND6), [stCOND7](#stCOND7), and [stCOND9](#stCOND9). It assumes that soils are "not saturated with water during some part of the summer" ([\![stCOND5](#stCOND5)]) and have "no [O-horizon](#Ohorizon)", when testing for the [cryic](#Cryic) regime with [[stCOND8](#stCOND8)].
    * rSFSW2 ignores "[organic soils](#OSM)", but consideres the presence of [O-horizons](#Ohorizon).

    * "Soil is > 0 to < 8 C (but warmer than cryic soils in summer)"
* Remarks
    * Unclear why [jNSM 2016](#jNSM2016) appears to apply a scaled version of [COND5](#COND5)

## Definitions of conditions
Our interpretations from [SSS 2014](#SSS2014) -- language refers to layers, not parts

* __dry__ := soil water potential < -1.5 MPa "the moisture tension is 1500 kPa or more" ([p. 29, SSS 2014](#SSS2014))
* __moist/wet__ := soil water potential >= -1.5 MPa "water is held at a tension of less than 1500 kPa but more than zero" ([p. 29, SSS 2014](#SSS2014))
* __saturated__ := soil water potential >= -0.033 MPa

* __<a name="histic_epipedon"/>histic epipedon</a>__ := a horizon that is periodically saturated with water and that has sufficiently high amounts of organic carbon (O.C. 12 to 18%, by weight, depending on clay content) to be considered organic soil material. Typically, it is at (or near) the surface and is peat or muck at least 20 cm thick." ([p.3-10, SSS 2015](#SSS2015))
* __<a name="Ohorizon"/>O horizon</a>__ := "Horizons [...] dominated by organic soil materials. [...] Some O horizons [...] consist of slightly decomposed to highly decomposed litter, such as leaves, needles, twigs, moss, and lichens, that has been deposited on the surface of either mineral or organic soils." ([p. 335, SSS 2014](#SSS2014))
* __<a name="OSM"/>organic soil material</a>__ := "Soil material that contains more than the amounts of organic carbon described above for mineral soil material is considered organic soil material" ([p. 3, SSS 2014](#SSS2014))
* __<a name="MSM"/>mineral soil material</a>__ := "(less than 2.0 mm in diameter) _either_:
    1) Is saturated with water for less than 30 days (cumulative) per year in normal years and contains less than 20 percent (by weight) organic carbon; _or_
    2) Is saturated with water for 30 days or more (cumulative) in normal years (or is artificially drained) and, excluding live roots, has an organic carbon content (by weight) of:
        * Less than 18 percent if the mineral fraction contains 60 percent or more clay; _or_
        * Less than 12 percent if the mineral fraction contains no clay; _or_
        * Less than 12 + (clay percentage multiplied by 0.1) percent if the mineral fraction contains less than 60 percent clay." ([p. 3, SSS 2014](#SSS2014))

#### jNSM inputs

* precip[1:12] = monthly precipitation in mm
* temperature[1:12] = mean monthly air temperature in C
* mpe[1:12] = monthly potential evaporation in mm based on Thornthwaite 1948
* fc = 2.5 = Degree offset between soil and air temperature in Celsius [Comment: this value is being applied in the code to both monthly and annual data]
* fcd = 0.66 = Soil-Air Relationship Amplitude
