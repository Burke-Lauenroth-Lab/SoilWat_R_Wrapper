### Obtain the source package

There are several options:

- Download the
  [package zip file](https://github.com/Burke-Lauenroth-Lab/rSFSW2/archive/master.zip)
  via your web browser.

- Use git to clone
  ```
  git clone -b master --single-branch https://github.com/Burke-Lauenroth-Lab/rSFSW2.git rSFSW2
  ```

- Use git to clone step by step
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/Burke-Lauenroth-Lab/rSFSW2.git rSFSW2
  cd rSFSW2/
  git checkout master
  ```

### Installation

'rSFSW2' will compile some c code via 'Rcpp'. Your computer must be set up adequately.
- If you use a Windows OS, then you need the
  [Rtools](http://cran.us.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)
  installed that match your R version; please find further information for instance
  [here](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/Rintro/Rwinpack.html).
- If you use a macOS, then you need [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and
  its [command-line tools](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/technotes/tn2339/_index.html)
  installed; please find further information for instance
  [here](https://railsapps.github.io/xcode-command-line-tools.html).


After you downloaded the source package, run
```
R CMD INSTALL rSFSW2
```

Or do all at once from within R:
```{r}
system2(command = "git", args = "clone -b master --single-branch https://github.com/Burke-Lauenroth-Lab/rSFSW2.git rSFSW2")
tools::Rcmd(args = paste("INSTALL rSFSW2"))
```

### Binary package version
If you want a binary version of the 'rSFSW2' package (e.g., to distribute to someone
without development tools) for a platform to which you do not have access, then you may
consider using one of the cloud services (no endorsements):
- [r-hub](https://builder.r-hub.io) offers different Linux, Windows, and mac OS flavors as targets
- [win-builder](http://win-builder.r-project.org/) offers Windows OS as target

Alternatively, you may access the previous binary package version for Windows OS from our
CI appveyor service if the build was successful and an artifact was generated for the
binary package (this would be named 'rSWSF2_X.Y.Z.zip' with version number X.Y.Z) from
[here](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/dschlaep/rSFSW2/build/artifacts). If the latest
build should have failed, then you may want to check out the 'History' tab for binaries
of older versions.

# Use rSFSW2 for your simulation project

Familiarize yourself with the demos and information at ```package?rSFSW2```

__Setup a new simulation project__:
1) Install and attach 'rSFSW2' if not already done so (Note: required version of
   rSOILWAT2 must already be present)
2) Create a skeleton project `setup_rSFSW2_project_infrastructure(dir_prj =
   "path/to/project_folder")
    - This function will copy a default version of '1_Data_SWInput' and the three demo R
    files to your directory
3) Work your way through 'SFSW2_project_code.R', i.e., define paths and actions, and
   provide simulation project description in 'SFSW2_project_descriptions.R' and run
   settings in 'SFSW2_project_settings.R'
